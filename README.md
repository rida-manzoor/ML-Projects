# ML-Projects

In this repository, different machine-learning projects are uploaded. All projects are for practice purposes. 

>Iris: In this file, the iris dataset is used from sklearn. This dataset has 150 observations, 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target column which tell us the flower specie (setosa, versicolor, virginica).  Data is already cleaned so EDA was not required. The logistic Regression model is used with an SGA solver. Cross-validation is also used to train and test the model on whole data. Accuracy is used as an evaluation metric for this model.
